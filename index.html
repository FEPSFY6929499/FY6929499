    <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Helicopters are unique aircraft that rely on rotary blades to generate lift, enabling vertical take‑off, hovering, and multidirectional flight. This paper explores the fundamental aerodynamics of helicopter flight by examining the four main forces acting on the aircraft: lift, weight, thrust, and drag...</p>

<h4>Lift</h4>
<pre id="Analysis_InText">
Lift is the upward force that allows a helicopter to rise in the air. This is produced by the rotary blades moving through the air, creating a pressure difference over and under the helicopter. By adjusting the pitch of the blades, pilots can increase and decrease the lift force, which allows them to move upwards, downwards, or hover. The way lift is generated can be explained using Bernoulli’s principle: air moves faster over the top surface of the blade, creating lower pressure, while slower air underneath creates higher pressure. This difference in pressure produces the upward force that keeps the helicopter in the air.

<h4>Weight</h4>
Weight is the opposing force to lift. It is caused by gravity acting on the mass of the helicopter. For flight, the lift force must be greater than the force from the weight. To overcome this, they use lightweight materials in rotor blades and the fuselage construction (the main body) to reduce the mass of the helicopter, which reduces the force acting on it from the weight. This improvement in efficiency reduces the power required, therefore lowering overall fuel consumption. Modern helicopters often use aluminium alloys, titanium, and carbon fibre composites because these materials are strong yet light. Reducing weight not only helps the helicopter take off more easily but also increases its range and payload capacity, meaning it can carry more passengers or equipment without using extra fuel.

<h4>Thrust</h4>
Thrust is the force that allows the helicopter to move sideways, forwards, and backwards. Instead of using wings like an airplane, helicopters achieve thrust by tilting the rotor blades. Helicopters angle the lift force, creating thrust to move in different directions. A challenge with this system is that tilting the blades reduces the amount of lift acting directly upward. Engineers help solve this by allowing the blades to change angle while rotating, which balances the forces and ensures more stable flight.

<h4>Drag</h4>
Drag is what opposes the thrust force. It comes from the air pushing against the helicopter body and rotor blades as it moves around. There are different types of drag. Parasitic drag is the resistance caused by the helicopter’s body and external parts as it moves through the air. The faster the helicopter flies, the more parasitic drag it experiences. This drag mainly comes from the fuselage (the central body that everything is attached to), landing gear, and other parts that stick out into the airflow. This can be reduced by making the fuselage more streamlined and covering exposed parts to make it more aerodynamic. This makes it more efficient, therefore requiring less fuel.

Another type of drag is induced drag, created when lift is produced. When the rotor blades create lift, they disrupt the airflow around them, which creates vortices at the blade tips that act against the lift force. Unlike parasitic drag, induced drag is strongest at low speeds and during hovering, because the blades need to work harder to generate enough lift force. This can be reduced by designing rotor blades with special shapes, such as tapered or twisted blades, which help reduce the vortices and make it more efficient.

In conclusion, helicopter flight depends on the balance of lift, weight, thrust, and drag. By controlling these forces through rotor blade design, lightweight materials, and aerodynamic shaping, engineers make helicopters efficient, stable, and versatile. This allows them to be used in many different roles such as emergency medical services, search and rescue operations and many more.
